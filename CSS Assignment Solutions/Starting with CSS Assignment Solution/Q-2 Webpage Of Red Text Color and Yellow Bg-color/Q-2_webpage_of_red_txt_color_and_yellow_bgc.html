        <p>
            CSS, which is stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to style an HTML file and tell the browser how it should render the element on the page. Before CSS all the webpages looked very similar and academic but after CSS was introduced, everything had changed. CSS let us move everything presentation-related from the HTML to the CSS so that HTML could get back to being the format that defines the structure of the document, rather than how things should look in the browser. CSS has evolved over time through different versions,which are CSS 1, CSS2, CSS2.1, CSS3. With each version introducing new features, improvements and capabilities for web designers and developers.<br/>
            There are three main ways/methods to implement CSS in a HTML document,which are Inline Stylesheet, Internal Stylesheet and External Stylesheet.
